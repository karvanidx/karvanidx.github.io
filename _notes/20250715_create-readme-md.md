# Generate README.md

by file `main.py` and our recent discussion:
```markdown
Write a comprehensive README.md file for this project based on main.py and our previous discussion. The README should include:

1. A clear project title and description
2. Key features and functionality
3. Installation instructions
4. Usage examples with code snippets
5. Dependencies and requirements
6. Any relevant configuration steps
7. Basic troubleshooting information

Format the README using proper Markdown syntax, ensuring it is well-organized with appropriate headings, lists, and code blocks. Keep the language professional yet accessible, and focus on providing practical, actionable information for users.

Please include any specific implementation details we discussed earlier in this section.
```
